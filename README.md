# AWS “Isometric-Cubist” Service and SDK Icons

Icons designed by [William Trekell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtrekell/) for Amazon Web Services.

These are SVGs for the Service and SDK icon sets as of 2014-04-18, which was my last day working at AWS.

These don't appear to be in-use anymore; my best guess by looking at the AWS Console is that they were ultimately replaced by the [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/).

This is a snapshot-in-time, and will not be updated. Icons are copyright (c) Amazon Web Services. Authored by [William Trekell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtrekell/) (design) and converted from Adobe Illustrator to SVG by Ryan Parman (code).
